## Cyclistic_Exercise_Full_Year_Analysis

We'll start by loading the different datasets to use in this analysis
```{r Loading Data}

## STEP 2: WRANGLE DATA AND COMBINE INTO A SINGLE FILE
##====================================================

# Renaming Columns

First we'll start by renaming some columns so that they match perfectly before we can use a command to join them into one file.

```{r Renaming Columns}
January <- January %>% rename(trip_id = ride_id, bikeid = rideable_type, start_time = started_at, end_time = ended_at, from_station_name = start_station_name, from_station_id = start_station_id, to_station_name = end_station_name, to_station_id = end_station_id, usertype = member_casual)        

February <- February %>% rename(trip_id = ride_id, bikeid = rideable_type, start_time = started_at, end_time = ended_at, from_station_name = start_station_name, from_station_id = start_station_id, to_station_name = end_station_name, to_station_id = end_station_id, usertype = member_casual)        

March <- March %>% rename(trip_id = ride_id, bikeid = rideable_type, start_time = started_at, end_time = ended_at, from_station_name = start_station_name, from_station_id = start_station_id, to_station_name = end_station_name, to_station_id = end_station_id, usertype = member_casual)        

April <- April %>% rename(trip_id = ride_id, bikeid = rideable_type, start_time = started_at, end_time = ended_at, from_station_name = start_station_name, from_station_id = start_station_id, to_station_name = end_station_name, to_station_id = end_station_id, usertype = member_casual, ride_length = ride_lenght)        

May <- May %>% rename(trip_id = ride_id, bikeid = rideable_type, start_time = started_at, end_time = ended_at, from_station_name = start_station_name, from_station_id = start_station_id, to_station_name = end_station_name, to_station_id = end_station_id, usertype = member_casual, ride_length = ride_lenght)        

June <- June %>% rename(trip_id = ride_id, bikeid = rideable_type, start_time = started_at, end_time = ended_at, from_station_name = start_station_name, from_station_id = start_station_id, to_station_name = end_station_name, to_station_id = end_station_id, usertype = member_casual, ride_length = ride_lenght)        

July <- July %>% rename(trip_id = ride_id, bikeid = rideable_type, start_time = started_at, end_time = ended_at, from_station_name = start_station_name, from_station_id = start_station_id, to_station_name = end_station_name, to_station_id = end_station_id, usertype = member_casual, ride_length = ride_lenght)        

August <- August %>% rename(trip_id = ride_id, bikeid = rideable_type, start_time = started_at, end_time = ended_at, from_station_name = start_station_name, from_station_id = start_station_id, to_station_name = end_station_name, to_station_id = end_station_id, usertype = member_casual, ride_length = ride_lenght)        

September <- September %>% rename(trip_id = ride_id, bikeid = rideable_type, start_time = started_at, end_time = ended_at, from_station_name = start_station_name, from_station_id = start_station_id, to_station_name = end_station_name, to_station_id = end_station_id, usertype = member_casual, ride_length = ride_lenght)        

October <- October %>% rename(trip_id = ride_id, bikeid = rideable_type, start_time = started_at, end_time = ended_at, from_station_name = start_station_name, from_station_id = start_station_id, to_station_name = end_station_name, to_station_id = end_station_id, usertype = member_casual, ride_length = ride_lenght)        

November <- November %>% rename(trip_id = ride_id, bikeid = rideable_type, start_time = started_at, end_time = ended_at, from_station_name = start_station_name, from_station_id = start_station_id, to_station_name = end_station_name, to_station_id = end_station_id, usertype = member_casual, ride_length = ride_lenght)        

December <- December %>% rename(trip_id = ride_id, bikeid = rideable_type, start_time = started_at, end_time = ended_at, from_station_name = start_station_name, from_station_id = start_station_id, to_station_name = end_station_name, to_station_id = end_station_id, usertype = member_casual, ride_length = ride_lenght)        

```


# Converting Data Types

Now lets Convert trip_id and bikeid to character so that they can stack correctly


```{r Converting Data types}
January <- January %>% 
  mutate(trip_id = as.character(trip_id)) %>% 
  mutate(bikeid = as.character(bikeid))

February <- February %>% 
  mutate(trip_id = as.character(trip_id)) %>% 
  mutate(bikeid = as.character(bikeid))

March <- March %>% 
  mutate(trip_id = as.character(trip_id)) %>% 
  mutate(bikeid = as.character(bikeid))

April <- April %>% 
  mutate(trip_id = as.character(trip_id)) %>% 
  mutate(bikeid = as.character(bikeid))

May <- May %>% 
  mutate(trip_id = as.character(trip_id)) %>% 
  mutate(bikeid = as.character(bikeid))

June <- June %>% 
  mutate(trip_id = as.character(trip_id)) %>% 
  mutate(bikeid = as.character(bikeid))

July <- July %>% 
  mutate(trip_id = as.character(trip_id)) %>% 
  mutate(bikeid = as.character(bikeid))

August <- August %>% 
  mutate(trip_id = as.character(trip_id)) %>% 
  mutate(bikeid = as.character(bikeid))

September <- September %>% 
  mutate(trip_id = as.character(trip_id)) %>% 
  mutate(bikeid = as.character(bikeid))

October <- October %>% 
  mutate(trip_id = as.character(trip_id)) %>% 
  mutate(bikeid = as.character(bikeid))

November <- November %>% 
  mutate(trip_id = as.character(trip_id)) %>% 
  mutate(bikeid = as.character(bikeid))

December <- December %>% 
  mutate(trip_id = as.character(trip_id)) %>% 
  mutate(bikeid = as.character(bikeid))

```

# Merging DataFrames 

Now its time to stack the different dataframes into a single dataframe

```{r Stacking the Data}
Annual_Trips <- bind_rows(January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December)
```


##======================================================
## STEP 3: CLEAN UP AND ADD DATA TO PREPARE FOR ANALYSIS
##======================================================

# Deleting unnecessary columns

Annual_Trips <- Annual_Trips %>% 
  select(-c(start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng, ride_length_Period))

# Creating and Converting column date frome Character to Date format 

```{r Creating Columns}
Annual_Trips$date <- as.Date(Annual_Trips$start_time, format = "%m/%d/%Y")
Annual_Trips$month <- format(as.Date(Annual_Trips$date), "%B")
Annual_Trips$day <- format(as.Date(Annual_Trips$date), "%d")
Annual_Trips$year <- format(as.Date(Annual_Trips$date), "%Y")
Annual_Trips$day_of_week <- format(as.Date(Annual_Trips$date), "%A")
```

Changing datatype of ride_length from character to numeric for calculations

```{r}
Annual_Trips$ride_length_Period <- lubridate::hms(Annual_Trips$ride_length)  # First we change it to Period datatype

Annual_Trips$ride_length_Seconds <- period_to_seconds(Annual_Trips$ride_length_Period) # Now use the period_to_seconds function to convert to seconds
```

Now lets remove unnecessary data (When Bikes where  out for repair or where ride_length is negative)

```{r Deleting Blanks}
Annual_Trips_v2 <- Annual_Trips[!(Annual_Trips$from_station_name == "HQ QR" | Annual_Trips$ride_length_Seconds < 0),]

```

##=====================================
## STEP 4: CONDUCT DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS
##=====================================


# Descriptive analysis on ride_length (all figures in seconds)

summary(Annual_Trips_v2$ride_length_Seconds)

Compare members and casual users

```{r Comparing UserTypes}
aggregate(Annual_Trips_v2$ride_length_Seconds ~ Annual_Trips_v2$usertype, FUN = mean)
aggregate(Annual_Trips_v2$ride_length_Seconds ~ Annual_Trips_v2$usertype, FUN = median)
aggregate(Annual_Trips_v2$ride_length_Seconds ~ Annual_Trips_v2$usertype, FUN = max)
aggregate(Annual_Trips_v2$ride_length_Seconds ~ Annual_Trips_v2$usertype, FUN = min)

```

See the average ride time by each day for members vs casual users
```{r}
aggregate(Annual_Trips_v2$ride_length_Seconds ~ Annual_Trips_v2$usertype + Annual_Trips_v2$day_of_week, FUN = mean)

```

Notice that the days of the week are out of order. Let's fix that.
```{r}
Annual_Trips_v2$day_of_week <- ordered(Annual_Trips_v2$day_of_week, levels=c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))

```

Now, let's run the average ride time by each day for members vs casual users
```{r}
aggregate(Annual_Trips_v2$ride_length_Seconds ~ Annual_Trips_v2$usertype + Annual_Trips_v2$day_of_week, FUN = mean)

```


Analyze ridership data by type and weekday
```{r Analysing Usertype}
Annual_Trips_v2 %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(Annual_Trips_v2$day_2, label = TRUE)) %>%  #creates weekday field using wday()
  group_by(usertype, weekday) %>%  #groups by usertype and weekday
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()							#calculates the number of rides and average duration 
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length_Seconds)) %>% 		# calculates the average duration
  arrange(usertype, weekday)								# sorts
```



## Including Plots

# Let's visualize the number of rides by rider type

Checking on how many rides are made per day of the week by each usertype

```{r Plot 1, echo=FALSE}
Annual_Trips_v2 %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(Annual_Trips_v2$day_2, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(usertype, weekday) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length_Seconds)) %>% 
  arrange(usertype, weekday) %>% 
  filter(usertype != "NA", weekday != "NA") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = number_of_rides, fill = usertype)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  ggtitle("Weekly Rides per Usertype")
```


# Let's create a visualization for average duration

Checking on the average duration of each ride made per day of the week by each usertype

```{r Plot 2, echo=FALSE}
Plot2 <- Annual_Trips_v2 %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(Annual_Trips_v2$day_2, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(usertype, weekday) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length_Seconds)) %>% 
  arrange(usertype, weekday)  %>% 
  filter(weekday != "NA", average_duration != "NA") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = average_duration, fill = usertype)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  ggtitle("Weekly Average Ride Duration for Users")

```

Yearly_Data <- aggregate(Annual_Trips_v2$ride_length_Seconds ~ Annual_Trips_v2$usertype + Annual_Trips_v2$day_of_week, FUN = mean)
